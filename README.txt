My solution to our exam project in Python for the "Introduction to Programming in Python and R for Biosciences" course.

The task is described in the "3FB221-final_hard.pdf" and consisted mainly of extracting mutation counts out of a sequence data file ("stu_30.dat").
Only base Python without additional packages was allowed to use.

The lecturers feedback:
Good solution to the harder problem.
Great use of functions and comments for code separation and clarity.
Unusual spacing of the columns in the output but otherwise correct format.
Mutation counts were correct.
No changes requested.
